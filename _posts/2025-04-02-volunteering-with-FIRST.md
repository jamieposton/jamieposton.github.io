From 2016 to 2024, I volunteered as a Game Announcer and Master of Ceremonies for middle and high school robotics competitions. My role involved introducing parents and teachers to the program while also creating an exciting atmosphere for the students and coaches. This included conducting opening and closing ceremonies, presenting awards to deserving teams, and giving a high-energy play-by-play of the matches. [Here's a video of one of the matches I announced for.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjh8L7b65-4)

My time announcing culminated with two back-to-back years volunteering at the FIRST World Championship in Houston, Texas. Going from smaller Nevada competitions with 30 teams to an event with over 5 times that number of teams was mind boggling! [Here's a timestamp of one of the matches I announced for, from the Franklin division.](https://youtu.be/ro3xkQsvzQw?t=5332)

I also was fortunate to coach the Crazy Canary Controllers/Constant Voltage from 2020-2022. Coaching was an incredibly rewarding experience, and it was exciting to see the team strive for success in mechanical and computer science engineering. My philosophy was to ensure the students did the majority of the work, while I focused on managing the administrative side and helping troubleshoot issues with the robot. Since they were a relatively new team, our goal was to be "Not last!". And they made it! They ended up placing near the middle of the pack, which was a huge achievement, and they were even recognized with an award for their programming skills.
