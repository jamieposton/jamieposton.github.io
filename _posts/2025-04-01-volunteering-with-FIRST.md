From 2016 to 2024, I volunteered as a Game Announcer and Master of Ceremonies for middle and high school robotics competitions. My role was to introduce parents and teachers to the program while also making it exciting for the students and coaches. This included conducting opening and closing ceremonies, giving out awards to deserving teams, and giving a high-speed play-by-play of the matches. [Here's a video of one of the matches I announced for.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjh8L7b65-4)

My time announcing culminated with two back-to-back years volunteering at the FIRST World Championship in Houston, Texas. Going from smaller Nevada competitions of 30 teams over 5 times that number was mind boggling! [Here's a timestamp of one of the matches I announced for, from the Franklin division.](https://youtu.be/ro3xkQsvzQw?t=5332)

I also was lucky enough to coach the Crazy Canary Controllers/Constant Voltage from 2020-2022. Coaching was such a rewarding experience and it was so exciting to see the team strive for success in mechanical and computer science engineering. My philosophy was to make sure the students did the majority of the work, while my role was to make sure the administrative side went smoothly and to help troubleshoot issues with the robot. Since we were a relatively new team, our goal was to be "Not last!". And we made it! We ended up placing near the middle of the pack which was amazing, and they were even recognized with an award for their programming skills.
