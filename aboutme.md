subtitle: Native Nevadian and Excitable Engineer
---

My name is Jamie Poston. I'm a machine learning engineer with a passion for natural language processing, robotics, and computer vision. I'm on the job hunt for my next role. Here are some of my highlight qualities:

- My Python skills are exemplary: I can troubleshoot and add features til the sun comes down.
- I have a solid understanding of machine learning fundamentals and how to apply them in cost-effective and solution-oriented methods.
- I am a definite culture addition: I led a team-building guild at my last role, organizing cross-team book clubs and facilitating multi-background creative projects.
- My communication skills are on point. I can describe my findings to a team of engineers, product managers, and/or data scientists and make sure all our questions are answered and we're on the same page.
- I have experience with the real-world issues of deploying production-level machine learning models to multiple consumers with multiple stakeholders and making sure all our needs are heard and addressed.
- I can juggle multiple repositories and microservices and make sure their deployment process is consistent and easy to use for our developers.
- I can also juggle in real-life!

Sound like a good fit? Feel free to reach out to chat.

## Background

I graduated from the University of Nevada, Reno with a bachelor's and master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering. While in school my main focus was machine learning and robotics, which is what my senior project and master's thesis focused on.

I took a bunch of machine learning and robotics related classes, including:

- Autonomous Mobile Robotics
- Big Data
- Computational Linguistics
- Computer Vision
- Convex Optimization
- Deep Learning
- Evolutionary Computing
- Graph Theory and Combinatorics
- Operations Research
- Machine Learning Applications

Besides classes, I also made time for clubs and organizations during college, including the Nevada Cyber Club, the Association for Computing Machinery, Plant Club, and the Queer Student Union.

I've worked on a couple projects that you can find highlighted in the navbar, including my master's thesis: [Predicting Agent Behavior by Estimating Motion Planners](https://www.jamieposton.github.io/mastersthesis/)

In my free time I enjoy gardening and playing video games, depending on the time of year.

### Natural Language Processing and Engineering Work at Research Square

I worked at Research Square for nearly 5 years. While I won't be able to go into the details of what I did there, the gist of it is that I worked on models that made edits to sentences for the purpose of helping authors with their writing before submitting scientific papers to journals and conferences. I did everything from model training to developing new methods of model evaluation for different tasks. I supported the automation team with deployments and code maintance, and participated in detailed design and code reviews.

One of my latest projects was standardizing the build process over 11 separate repositories. Even though that wasn't machine learning focused, it was still one of my favorites because I could see how it made a difference with my team by allowing them to more rapidly iterate and develop. Another valuable use of my time there was mentoring a machine learning intern over the summer of 2022. I helped him with everything from intiial setup to model training to presenting the final results of the project.

Another way I made an impact at my previous job was by really looking into how we evaluated models. For one model, we directly compared outputs between models A and B. From the engineering side, it made sense! Either model A or B was better, and if you're unsure you can just pick one and any biases should come out in the wash after we evaluate a lot of predictions. However, after talking with editors, sometimes neither model is good. Or, in many cases, both models made a bad edit and it was hard to choose the least-worst outcome! From that feedback, I created a different way of evaluating model results where we rate each model prediction, then compare the labels on the same data. This allowed us to quickly dig into the details of how one model was doing on different types of data. It really helped our evaluation process for every model we trained moving forward.

### Volunteer Outreach with FIRST Tech Challenge and FIRST Lego League

From 2016 to 2024, I volunteered as a Game Announcer and Master of Ceremonies for middle and high school robotics competitions. My role was to introduce parents and teachers to the program while also making it exciting for the students and coaches. This included conducting opening and closing ceremonies, giving out awards to deserving teams, and giving a high-speed play-by-play of the matches. [Here's a video of one of the matches I announced for.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjh8L7b65-4)

My time announcing culminated with two back-to-back years volunteering at the FIRST World Championship in Houston, Texas. Going from smaller Nevada competitions of 30 teams over 5 times that number was mind boggling! [Here's a timestamp of one of the matches I announced for, from the Franklin division.](https://youtu.be/ro3xkQsvzQw?t=5332)

I also was lucky enough to coach the Crazy Canary Controllers/Constant Voltage from 2020-2022. Coaching was such a rewarding experience and it was so exciting to see the team strive for success in mechanical and computer science engineering. My philosophy was to make sure the students did the majority of the work, while my role was to make sure the administrative side went smoothly and to help troubleshoot issues with the robot. Since we were a relatively new team, our goal was to be "Not last!". And we made it! We ended up placing near the middle of the pack which was amazing, and they were even recognized with an award for their programming skills.
