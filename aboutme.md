subtitle: Native Nevadan and Excitable Engineer
---

My name is Jamie Poston. I'm a machine learning engineer with a passion for natural language processing, robotics, and computer vision. I'm on the job hunt for my next role. Here are some of my highlight qualities:

- My Python skills are exemplary: I can troubleshoot and add features til the sun comes down.
- I have a solid understanding of machine learning fundamentals and how to apply them in cost-effective and solution-oriented methods.
- I am a definite culture addition: I led a team-building guild at my last role, organizing cross-team book clubs and facilitating multi-background creative projects.
- My communication skills are on point. I can describe my findings to a team of engineers, product managers, and/or data scientists and make sure all our questions are answered and we're on the same page.
- I have experience with the real-world issues of deploying production-level machine learning models to multiple consumers with multiple stakeholders and making sure all our needs are heard and addressed.
- I can juggle multiple repositories and microservices and make sure their deployment process is consistent and easy to use for our developers.
- I can also juggle in real-life!

Sound like a good fit? Feel free to reach out to chat.

## Background

I graduated from the University of Nevada, Reno with a bachelor's and master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering. While in school my main focus was machine learning and robotics, which is what my senior project and master's thesis focused on.

I took a bunch of machine learning and robotics related classes, including:

- Autonomous Mobile Robotics
- Big Data
- Computational Linguistics
- Computer Vision
- Convex Optimization
- Deep Learning
- Evolutionary Computing
- Graph Theory and Combinatorics
- Operations Research
- Machine Learning Applications

Besides classes, I also made time for clubs and organizations during college, including the Nevada Cyber Club, the Association for Computing Machinery, Plant Club, and the Queer Student Union.

I've worked on a couple projects that you can find highlighted in the navbar, including my master's thesis: [Predicting Agent Behavior by Estimating Motion Planners](https://www.jamieposton.github.io/mastersthesis/)

In my free time I enjoy gardening and playing video games, depending on the time of year.
