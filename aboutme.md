My name is Jamie Poston. I'm a machine learning engineer with a passion for natural language processing, robotics, and computer vision. I'm currently seeking my next role. Here are some of my key strengths:

- **Python Skills:** My Python skills are exemplary. I can troubleshoot and add features efficiently and effectively.
- **Machine Learning Fundamentals:** I have a solid understanding of core machine learning principles and how to apply them in cost-effective and solution-oriented methods.
- **Culture:** I thrive in team environments and actively work to maintain good company culture. I led a team-building guild at my last role, organizing cross-team book clubs and facilitating multi-background creative projects.
- **Communication:** I excel at conveying my findings to diverse teams of engineers, product managers, and data scientists, ensuring all our questions are answered and we're all aligned with our expectations.
- **Experience:** I've deployed production-level machine learning models to multiple consumers with multiple stakeholders, while making sure all needs are heard and addressed.
- **Consistency:** I can juggle multiple repositories and microservices and make sure their deployment and development process is consistent and easy to use.
- **Bonus:** I can also juggle in real-life!

## Background

For the past five years, I worked at Research Square doing [Machine Learning for scientific editing.](https://jamieposton.github.io/2025-04-01-Natural-Language-Processing-At-Research-Square/)

I also [volunteered](https://jamieposton.github.io/2025-04-02-volunteering-with-FIRST/) at robotics competitions.

I graduated from the University of Nevada, Reno with both a bachelor's and master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering. My academic focus was on machine learning and robotics, which were the subjects of my [senior project](https://jamieposton.github.io/imwalkinghere) and [master's thesis](https://jamieposton.github.io/mastersthesis).

During my time in school, I took a variety of courses related to machine learning and robotics, including:

- Autonomous Mobile Robotics
- Big Data
- Computational Linguistics
- Computer Vision
- Convex Optimization
- Deep Learning
- Evolutionary Computing
- Graph Theory and Combinatorics
- Operations Research
- Machine Learning Applications

In addition to my coursework, I also made time for clubs and organizations during college, including the Nevada Cyber Club, the Association for Computing Machinery, Plant Club, and the Queer Student Union.

In my free time I enjoy gardening and playing video games, depending on the season.
