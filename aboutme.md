My name is Jamie Poston. I'm a machine learning engineer with a passion for natural language processing, robotics, and computer vision. I'm on the job hunt for my next role! Here are some of my highlight qualities:

- My Python skills are exemplary: I can troubleshoot and add features til the sun comes down.
- I have a solid understanding of machine learning fundamentals and how to apply them in cost-effective and solution-oriented methods.
- I am a definite culture addition: I led a team-building guild at my last role, organizing cross-team book clubs and facilitating multi-background creative projects.
- My communication skills are on point. I can describe my findings to a team of engineers, product managers, and/or data scientists and make sure all our questions are answered and we're on the same page.
- I have experience with the real-world issues of deploying production-level machine learning models to multiple consumers with multiple stakeholders and making sure all our needs are heard and addressed.
- I can juggle multiple repositories and microservices and make sure their deployment process is consistent and easy to use for our developers.
- I can also juggle in real-life!
